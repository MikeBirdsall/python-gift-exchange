     2) possibly an option to filter by year/event (what id I buy in the last 2 months)
     3) clan / secret santa filter display (limits the number of people)
E) Change Password
     1) (family page button) to cancel out and get back to main menu
     2) "About this script" and "Exit from password changing pages"
          need different links but they are currently the same
     3) Perhaps page should fill in ident but ask for old password and then new password twice
          do all administrator functions in Administrator menu
F) Administrator Menu
	For non Administrators a (Family page) button to get them back to main menu

G) Database Ideas
	Ident - password - Full name - Display name - e-mail address       (one/person)
	Ident - clan - ?secret Santa group - spouse ident                  (one or more per person)
	Ident - proxy for ident                                            (zero of more per person)
	Ident - self? - Desired - Description - expires - reserved - purchased - Notes (many/person)
	Ident (buyer) - Ident (requestor) - Description - reserved? - purchased? - Notes (many/person)
	
	
	Key for Database ideas
	     Ident  - identification of person (ed is mine)
	     Full Name - full name for lists and such
	     Display name - name displayed instead of ident (Michael James or Michael instead of mike2)
	     clan - family group ID right now Birdsall and Kirkup
	     ?secret Santa Group - either none or name of a Secret Santa group say Birdsall or bird1
	     purchased - decrements desired in others display of ones list - numeric
	     reserved - just a display number showing intent - goes to 0 if purchsed by reserver
