<h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Michael and I are working on a newer updated version of Michael's perl script website for Wish List used for
Christmas and other gift giving events for the family.  As part of this we are presenting various web pages for people<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to review and see if they like or have ideas of changes or alternates.  So we are looking for feedback on how you like this or suggestions for changes, additions and deletions.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Note1:  These initial pages are designed for the Personal Computer and may not display well on tablets or smart phones.  We hope to get to that shortly after we have pages for things working for computers.</b><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Note2:  These are not an exhaustive listing of all the possible pages as we are still working on others and revisions of these.</b><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Note 3: Most of the examples are based on Edward Birdsall.  If you belong to more than one "Clan" then you would see information on all clans.  Currently clans used for examples are Birdsall and Kirkup.</b><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Note 4: The buttons on the pages are not active yet so we will be adding tabs to show off the pages</b>

<h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Processes and Views</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="user_home.html" target ="_blank">Home Page</a></li>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every user when they sign in start at their home page.  The example is <a href="user_home.html" target ="_blank">Edward Birdsall's Home Page</a>.   From here the user will go to other pages and return here as desired to continue working on things.  You will notice a number of changes on the pages and how you get around the website.<br />

<li><a href="calendar.html" target=_blank">Calendar Page</a></li>
     Here the <a href="calendar.html" target=_blank">calendar page</a> is for March 2019 and has a number of different calendar events displayed.
<li>Update my List</li>
     <ol>
     <li>We are trying to have links able to goto alternate wish sites like Amazon and debating on how that would work.</li>
     <li>Checking my list and editing those items that need update or deletion</li>
           To change an item or delete an item on the list the <a href="user_edit_sug-edt_oo.html" target="_blank">Edit button</a> and would go to a web page which would show item detail and allow for changing things or delete it.  After you edit the suggestion and hit the  <a href="user_edit_sug-ver_oo.html" target="_blank">Submit Suggestion button</a> or hit the  <a href="user_edit_sug-del_oo.html" target="_blank">Delete Suggestion button</a> you will go to a page to verify that you wish to do this.  If when you got to verify and you spot something wrong you can hit the Return to Editing button to correct and verify again.
     <li> <a href="user_edit_sug-add_oo.html" target="_blank">Adding items</a> not on the list</li>
     If you wish to add an item there is an  <a href="user_edit_sug-add_oo.html" target="_blank">Add Item button</a> which will send you to an Add item page where you can add an item and then verify it to get it on your list.

               <b>Note: If you only selcted one person then you would get a single person listed and not multiple as shown above</b></li>
     <ul>
