<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Mike and Ed are working on a new updated version of the Wish List site.
We would like to get feedback and suggestions on layout, organization, and well, whatever.
So we've mocked up (they don't work yet) web pages that give a first draft idea.
with some description about how you move between them.</p>

<p>And that's where you are, at the description about pages you would go through,  in doing some of your activities on site, and links to the various pages (mocked up) that you would use. </p>
<p>One overall change is that everyone will have a <a href="user_home.html" target ="_blank">home page</a> which is where you will normally start (instead of the old menu page) which will show a bunch of information as well as letting you pick the various things you may want to do.</p>
<p>
Another is there is a new "shopping list" page you can use to track your plans and purchases. You create it by selecting things you have decided you will (or might) go shopping to get, and use it to track what you have and haven't yet gotten, and what you have left to do.</p>

<h2>The Pages and what you can do on them.</h2>
<ul>
<li>Your Home page - By default you start at you Home Page when you log in. See the information particular to you, including your personal information and your wish list. From here you can change your wish list, or select among other pages.
The example is <a href="user_home.html" target ="_blank">Edward Birdsall's Home Page</a>.  </li>
     <li>Calendar Page - A new page is the <a href="calendar.html" target=_blank">calendar page</a> listing events pertinent for the site. The example is March 2019. We'd love to have more feedback on if you would like this, and what you would like (and not like) to see listed.</li>

<li>Update Your List - Starting at your <a href="user_home.html" target ="_blank">Home Page</a> use the <a href="user_edit_sug-edt_oo.html" target="_blank">Edit</a> 
Buttons for an item in the list or the <a href="user_edit_sug-add_oo.html" target="_blank">Add Item</a> button under your list to:</li>
<ul>

<li>Edit an Item - click an <a href="user_edit_sug-edt_oo.html" target="_blank">Edit button</a> takes you to a web page that shows you detail and lets you change it for the item it corresponds to. 
After you edit the suggestion and hit the  <a href="user_edit_sug-ver_oo.html" target="_blank">Submit Suggestion button</a> or hit the  <a href="user_edit_sug-del_oo.html" target="_blank">Delete Suggestion button</a> you will go to a page to verify it or go back to Editing.
</li>

<li> Add a new item to the list - click on the <a href="user_edit_sug-add_oo.html" target="_blank">Add Item button</a> which will send you to an Add item page where you can add an item and then verify it to get it on your list.
</li>
</ul>
<li>Alternate List Site - We plan to have links able to go to alternate wish list sites like Amazon, but haven't designed anything yet. All suggestions appreciated.

<li>Other people's wish lists - Pick list(s) by clicking on <a href="user_pick_list.html" target="_blank">Wish List</a> button on your Home Page, and the selecting one or more and then clicking on <a href="user_single_list-an.html" target="_blank">Display</a>(If you picked multiple people, you get a list like <a href="user_multiple_list.html" target="_blank">this)</a></li>
<ul>
 <li> <a href="user_edit_sug-add_os.html" target="_blank">Adding an item</a> to their list by clicking on the Add Suggestion button under their wish list</li>
    <li> <a href="user_edit_sug-edt_os.html" target="_blank">Add to the note(s)</a> for an item on their list by clicking on the View Details button for that item and then Edit button.</li>
</ul>
<li>Make up a new shopping list - Start your list by clicking on <a href="user_pick_list.html" target="_blank">Wish List</a> button on your Home Page, 
<ul>
<li>Choose the people on the list and click on <a href="shop_list_gen.html" target="_blank">Create Shopping List</a> which will automatically populate that next page with the available items for those people (or person).</li>
<li>Choose the items you want on your shopping list by choosing the Select or Reserve button for that item. Select will put in on the List, Reserve will mark it so other people know you are planning to buy it.</li>
<li>Click on <a href="user_shop.html" target="_blank">Create My Shopping List</a>Do people need to have more than one shopping list available?</li>
</ul>
<li>Go shopping with your shopping list - Click on <a href="user_shop.html" target="_blank">Shopping List</a> on your Home Page and you can:</li>
 <ul>
     <li>Mark an item bought by clicking on BUY at the end of an item. You can still, of course, mark it bought on that person's <a href="user_single_list-an.html" target="_blank">wish list</a> by clicking on Buy.</li>
 <li>Unreserve an item by clicking on Discard button for that item.</li>
 <li>Unbuy an item by clicking on Undo-Purchase button for that item.</li>
 <li>Show someone's wish list from your shopping list by clicking on the Show List button on the end of row with their name.</li>
 </ul>
<li>You can check on what you have purchased for whom, along with the people on your shopping list you haven't bought anything for yet by clicking on the <a href="user_purch.html" target ="_blank">Gifts Purchased</a> button on your Home Page</li>
</ul>
<h3>Some notes:</h3>
<ul style="padding-left:75px">
<li>These initial pages are designed for the Personal Computer and may not display well on tablets or smart phones.  We hope to get to that shortly after we have pages for things working for computers.</li>
<li>These are not an exhaustive listing of all the possible pages as we are still working on others and revisions of these.</li>
<li>Most of the examples are based on Edward Birdsall.  If you belong to more than one "Clan" then you would see information on all clans.  Currently clans used for examples are Birdsall and Kirkup.</li>
<li>The buttons on the pages are not active yet so we will be adding tabs to show off the pages</li>
</ul>
